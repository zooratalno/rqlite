However, GTA Liberty City is not officially supported on Windows XP, which is an outdated operating system that Microsoft stopped updating in 2014. If you want to play GTA Liberty City on Windows XP, you will need to follow some steps to make it work. Here are some tips on how to do that.
 
## Step 1: Download GTA Liberty City
 
The first step is to download GTA Liberty City from a reliable source. You can find many websites that offer GTA Liberty City game free download for Windows XP, but be careful of malware and viruses that may harm your computer. One of the safest sources is Ocean of Games, which provides a direct link to the game setup file. You can visit their website and click on the download button to start downloading the game.
 
## Step 2: Install GTA Liberty City
 
The next step is to install GTA Liberty City on your Windows XP computer. To do that, you will need to have at least 8 GB of free hard disk space and 1 GB of RAM. You will also need a graphics card that supports DirectX 9.0c and a sound card that is compatible with DirectX 9.0c.
 
Once you have downloaded the game setup file, you will need to run it as an administrator. You can do that by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Run as administrator". Then, you will need to follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to agree to some terms and conditions and choose a destination folder for the game.
 
## Step 3: Fix Camera Shake Issue
 
One of the common problems that many players face when playing GTA Liberty City on Windows XP is the camera shake issue. This is when the camera starts shaking uncontrollably during gameplay, making it hard to see what is happening on the screen. This issue is caused by a compatibility problem between the game and Windows XP.
 
To fix this issue, you will need to download a patch file called GTA IV Camera Shake Fix. You can find this file on Ocean of Games as well, under the same page where you downloaded the game setup file. You will need to click on the link that says "Click Here For Android Version of GTA Liberty City" and then scroll down until you see the download button for GTA IV Camera Shake Fix.
 
Once you have downloaded the patch file, you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called "GTA IV Camera Shake Fix". You will need to copy all the files inside this folder and paste them into your GTA Liberty City game folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA Liberty City. You will need to replace any existing files when prompted.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Playing GTA Liberty City
 
Now that you have installed and patched GTA Liberty City on your Windows XP computer, you are ready to enjoy playing it. You can launch the game by double-clicking on the icon on your desktop or by going to Start Menu > All Programs > Rockstar Games > GTA Liberty City. You can adjust the settings and options according to your preferences and start playing.
 
GTA Liberty City is a fun and exciting game that will keep you entertained for hours. You can explore the city, complete missions, drive cars, shoot guns, fight enemies, and more. You can also play online with other players or use mods to enhance your gameplay experience.

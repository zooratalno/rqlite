Not only will you learn 3D modeling in 3DS Max, but you will also discover the benefits of 3D modeling for design development and manufacturing. 3D modeling is a powerful tool that can help you create realistic, accurate and detailed models of your products, as well as test them for functionality, performance and aesthetics.
 
Some of the benefits of 3D modeling are:

- Agile: You can create digital renderings quickly and easily, and customize them for different clients or scenarios. You can also share them with anyone around the world in seconds.[^4^]
- Sustainable: You can reduce the waste and environmental impact of your products by using 3D modeling to evaluate different design options and minimize the need for physical prototypes.[^3^]
- Design competence: You can save time and money by using 3D modeling to review, test and update each component of your product before going into production. You can also spot and fix any design flaws that might not be visible in 2D drawings.[^2^]
- Easy and flexible prototyping: You can use 3D modeling to create a product prototype that can show you the design concept, details, production costs and more. You can also make changes and improvements to your prototype without having to start from scratch.[^3^]
- Quick fixes and remodeling: You can use 3D modeling to identify and correct any design errors or issues before they become costly or problematic. You can also modify or enhance your design easily and efficiently.[^3^]
- Increases quality and efficiency: You can use 3D modeling to combine it with 2D techniques and explore new creative workflows. You can also show better quality of your work to your potential customers and increase your productivity.[^1^]
- Eliminates language barriers: You can use 3D modeling to communicate your design ideas clearly and effectively without relying on words or descriptions. You can also avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations that might occur with different languages or cultures.[^1^]

As you can see, 3D modeling is an essential skill for any designer who wants to create amazing products that meet the needs and expectations of their customers. By taking this course on Skillshare, you will learn how to use 3DS Max, one of the most widely used 3D software in the industry, and master the fundamentals of 3D modeling.

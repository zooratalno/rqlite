If you are a fan of the classic racing game Need For Speed II, you might have encountered some problems running it on modern Windows systems. The game was designed to use 3dfx Glide, a graphics API that was popular in the late 90s but is no longer supported by most graphics cards and drivers. Fortunately, there is a way to play Need For Speed II on Windows 10 with smooth graphics and sound, thanks to a tool called Glide Wrapper.

Glide Wrapper is a software that emulates the 3dfx Glide API and allows old games to run on modern hardware. It works by intercepting the calls to the Glide library and translating them to OpenGL or DirectX commands. Glide Wrapper can improve the graphics quality of old games by enabling features such as anti-aliasing, filtering, and resolution scaling.
 
To play Need For Speed II on Windows 10 with Glide Wrapper, you will need the following:
 
- The original Need For Speed II CD-ROM or ISO file.
- A CD-ROM drive or a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools.
- The latest version of Glide Wrapper from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/glidewrapper/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glidewrapper/).
- The correct configuration file for Need For Speed II from [https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=41853](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=41853).

Follow these steps to install and run the game:

1. Insert the Need For Speed II CD-ROM or mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software.
2. Copy the contents of the CD-ROM or ISO file to a folder on your hard drive. For example, C:\NFS2.
3. Download and extract the Glide Wrapper zip file to the same folder where you copied the game files. For example, C:\NFS2.
4. Download and copy the configuration file for Need For Speed II (nfs2se.conf) to the same folder where you extracted the Glide Wrapper files. For example, C:\NFS2.

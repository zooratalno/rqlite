- The PS2 games that you want to rip. They can be either CD or DVD games.

## How to Use USB Extreme

1. Connect your USB device to your PC and create two folders on it: CD and DVD. These folders will store your ripped games depending on their format.
2. Insert your PS2 game disc into your PC's DVD drive and run the USB Extreme program. Select your DVD drive letter and click Start.
3. The program will ask you to enter a name for your game. You can use any name you want, but make sure it is less than 32 characters and does not contain any spaces or special characters.
4. The program will then start ripping your game to your USB device. Depending on the size of your game, this may take some time.
5. When the ripping is done, the program will ask you if you want to rip another game. If you do, repeat steps 2-4. If not, click Exit.
6. Disconnect your USB device from your PC and connect it to your PS2. Make sure it is plugged into the first USB port (the one closer to the power button).
7. Turn on your PS2 and run the USB Extreme ELF file from your modded method of choice. You can copy it to your memory card or burn it to a CD.
8. You will see a list of your ripped games on the screen. Use the left or right D-pad buttons to switch between CD and DVD games. Use the up or down D-pad buttons to select a game. Press either X, O, or Start to launch a game.
9. Some games may require compatibility modes to run properly. You can enable these modes by holding certain buttons while selecting a game. Here are the available modes:
    - Triangle: Unhook Syscalls (Mode 3). This mode unloads USB Extreme after the game is loaded. Some games may crash without this mode.
    - Square: Force Synchronization. This mode prevents data read timeouts for some games that need faster loading speed (e.g. Final Fantasy XII and Viewtiful Joe).
    - L1/L2/R1/R2: Cache Size. This mode sets the cache size for data reading. A larger cache size may improve performance, but a too large cache size may cause crashes. The default cache size is 2 sectors (when no triggers are held). The available cache sizes are 8/16/24/32 sectors respectively.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- Make sure your USB device is defragmented before using it with USB Extreme. Your game files should be 0% fragmented for optimal performance.
- If you have trouble starting USB Extreme on your PS2, try changing the video mode by holding L1 or R1 when launching the ELF file. L1 will set PAL 50Hz mode and R1 will set NTSC 60Hz mode.
- If you want to use an alternative program to rip your games, you can try USBUtil or PS2DCDMP. They are compatible with USB Extreme and 0f148eb4a0
